    "# Off-Platform Project: Viral Tweets\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we are going to use the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm to predict whether a tweet will go viral. Before jumping into using the classifier, let's first consider the problem we're trying to solve. Which features of a tweet are most closely linked to its popularity? Maybe the number of hashtags or the number of links in the tweet strongly influences its popularity. Maybe its virality is dependent on how many followers the person has. Maybe it's something more subtle like the specific language used in the tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore these options by looking at the data we have available to us. We've imported the dataset and printed the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The total number of tweets in the dataset.\n",
    "* The columns, or features, of the dataset.\n",
    "* The text of the first tweet in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these features are dictionaries. For example, the feature `\"user\"` is a dictionary. We might want to use some of the information found in these sub-dictionaries. Print `all_tweets.loc[0][\"user\"]` to see what the `\"user\"` feature looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "After printing that, try printing just the `\"location\"` found in that `\"user\"` dictionary. For example, `all_tweets.loc[0][\"user\"][\"screen_name\"]` would give you only the screen name associated with the first tweet."

    "# Defining Viral Tweets\n",
    "\n",
    "A K-Nearest Neighbor classifier is a supervised machine learning algorithm, and as a result, we need to have a dataset with tagged labels. For this specific example, we need a dataset where every tweet is marked as viral or not viral. Unfortunately, this isn't a feature of our dataset &mdash; we'll need to make it ourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we define a viral tweet? A good place to start is to look at the number of retweets the tweet has. This can be found using the feature `\"retweet_count\"`. Let's say we wanted to create a column called `is_viral` that is a `1` if the tweet had more than `5` retweets and `0` otherwise. We could do that like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "all_tweets['is_viral'] = np.where(all_tweets['retweet_count'] > 5, 1, 0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using `5` as the benchmark for a viral tweet, let's use the median number of retweets. You can find that by calling the `median()` function on `all_tweets[\"retweet_count\"]`. Print the median number of retweets to understand what this threshold is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Print the number of viral tweets and non-viral tweets. You can do this using `all_tweets['is_viral'].value_counts()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "After finishing this project, consider coming back and playing with this threshold number. How do you think your model would work if it was trying to find incredibly viral tweets? For example, how would it work if it were looking for tweets with 1000 or more retweets?"
